### Dataset Exploration:
Existance of linearity is checked by data visualization and the correlation between dependent variable and independent vairables is shown.

### Regression:
#### Simple Linear Regression:
Simple Linear Regression technique is used for the dependent variable 'Production' and independent variable 'Area'.
We get the result as-

### Multivariate Linear Regression:
Multivariate Linear Regression technique is used for the dependent variable 'Production' and the independent variables 'Precipitation','Min_Temp','Cloude_Cover','Vapour_Pressure' and 'Area'.
We get the result as-
